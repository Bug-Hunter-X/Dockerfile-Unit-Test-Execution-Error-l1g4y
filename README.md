This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: failing to correctly manage dependencies and execute unit tests.  The initial Dockerfile uses the `unittest` module's `discover` function, but fails because it does not set the correct environment, making tests unable to locate required dependencies. The solution demonstrates using a requirements.txt file and running the `unittest` command more effectively in the dockerfile context.
